# AnxioSense Workflow Run

## Test Case

## Prompt Version
cot-oneshot-v1

## User Input
I'm a 21-year-old university student and I feel like my brain never shuts off. Even when nothing is actually wrong, I'm constantly thinking about what could go wrong next. I'll finish one assignment and immediately start stressing about the next one. Lately I've been having trouble sleeping because I keep replaying conversations in my head and wondering if I said something stupid. My friends tell me I'm overthinking but I genuinely can't stop. Is this just normal student stress or is something else going on?😔

## Final Report
```md
# AnxioSense Screening Support Report

## Assessment Overview

**Analysis Type:** Social Media Analysis

No structured questionnaire was available because this analysis was performed using secondary social media text. Results therefore rely only on linguistic, emotional, symptomatic, and contextual indicators identified in the written text.

## Supporting Findings
The report identified the following experiences in the provided text:
- Persistent worry
- Sleep disruption
- Anxiety
- Stress
- Academic stress

## Recommendation
Given these findings, it may be beneficial to discuss these concerns with a qualified healthcare professional. They can provide a comprehensive assessment and offer appropriate guidance.

## Evidence Agreement

**High** — The identified indicators were broadly consistent with the clinical guidance used.

## Limitations
This report is based solely on the information provided in the text. Missing context could affect interpretation. It is not intended as a clinical diagnosis but rather for screening support purposes. A qualified healthcare professional should perform a clinical assessment to establish an accurate diagnosis. Additionally, due to the nature of social media analysis, this report carries additional uncertainty compared to journal mode assessments.

This report is intended for screening support only and should not be considered a clinical diagnosis.

---

## Clinician Summary *(restricted — do not share with patient)*

**Validated Indicators:**
  - anxiety (Partially Supported)
  - stress (Partially Supported)
  - Excessive worry (Supported)
  - Academic stress (Supported)

**Evidence Confidence:** High

**Differential Considerations:**
Available information was insufficient to confidently distinguish anxiety-related symptoms from other possible conditions such as depression. Further clinical assessment would be required.

*This section is intended for qualified clinicians only and must not be shared with the patient as part of the screening output.*
