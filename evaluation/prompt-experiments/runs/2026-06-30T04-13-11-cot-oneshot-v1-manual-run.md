I have been constantly worrying about my grades and whether I will graduate on time. I struggle to sleep before exams and I feel overwhelmed most days. I cannot stop thinking about what will happen if I fail.

## GAD-7 Score
GAD-7 Self-Report Screening
Concern Pattern: Elevated Concern Pattern

Your responses over the past two weeks:
  1. Feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge
     → More than half the days
  2. Not being able to stop or control worrying
     → More than half the days
  3. Worrying too much about different things
     → More than half the days
  4. Trouble relaxing
     → Several days
  5. Being so restless that it is hard to sit still
     → Several days
  6. Becoming easily annoyed or irritable
     → Several days
  7. Feeling afraid, as if something awful might happen
     → Several days

Your responses suggest several experiences that are commonly associated with anxiety and may be affecting your well-being. It may be beneficial to discuss these concerns with a healthcare professional who can provide a more comprehensive assessment and appropriate guidance.

Note: The GAD-7 is a validated self-report screening instrument used 
as an internal reference. It is not a diagnostic tool. This result 
should not be considered a clinical assessment. If you have concerns 
about your mental health, please speak with a qualified healthcare professional.
