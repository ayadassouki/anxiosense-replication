"""Frozen dataset manifest.

Membership and ground truth are decided HERE, before any dispatch, from the
dataset row alone. The dispatch loop reads ground truth out of the manifest and
never calls a label mapper, so no model result can influence either.

Nothing about scope is hardcoded: the split, the exclusion rules and the source
file all come from the caller. 324 / 715 / 2627 appear nowhere in this module.
