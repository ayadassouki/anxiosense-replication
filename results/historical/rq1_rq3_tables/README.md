# RQ1–RQ3 publication tables

Presentation tables for the **already-frozen** AnxioSense RQ1–RQ3 analysis. This folder contains no new
analysis: it renders values that were computed, frozen and independently verified on 2026-09-21.

- **No experiment was rerun** and **no model API was called**.
- **No inferential analysis was changed.** Confidence intervals, permutation tests, McNemar tests and Holm
  corrections live in `results/inferential_2026-09-21/` and are not reproduced or recomputed here.
- **Nothing outside this folder was written.** All inputs are opened read-only and sha256-gated.
- Tables are generated **deterministically** by `code/generate_rq1_rq3_tables.py`: no timestamps, no
  randomness, identical bytes on every run.
- **RQ4** (expert Likert ratings and Cohen's kappa) is a separate evaluation and is **not** included here.

## Files

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `01_model_configuration.csv` / `.md` | Model, provider pin, observed provider, quantization directive, datasets, strategies, runs, decoding parameters |
| `02_dreaddit_results.csv` / `.md` | Dreaddit, 15 rows (5 models × 3 prompting strategies) |
| `03_goemotions_results.csv` / `.md` | GoEmotions, 15 rows |
| `04_latency_results.csv` / `.md` | RQ3 descriptive latency, 30 rows (both datasets) |
| `code/generate_rq1_rq3_tables.py` | The generator |

The `.md` files are the publication-ready renderings (3 decimals, mean ± SD). The `.csv` files carry the same
rendered strings **and** the unrounded mean/SD columns for reproducibility.

## Frozen inputs and hash verification

The generator aborts before writing anything if any hash differs.

## Grid assertions checked at generation time

- 150 cells — pass
- 100,350 records — pass
- `validation.passed = true` — pass
- 0 validation problems — pass
- `aggregate_results.csv` has 30 configuration rows; `per_run_results.csv` has 150 cell rows; each
  configuration has exactly runs 1–5.

Frozen grid timestamp: `2026-09-21T14:51:04.780606+00:00` · parser `1.0.0` · metric policy
`1.0.0`.

## Value policy

- Conditional accuracy, effective accuracy, macro F1, evaluability and all counts are taken **verbatim** from
  the frozen `aggregate_results.csv`. They were not recalculated for display.
- Macro precision and macro recall are not present in the frozen aggregates. They are taken from the verified
  full-precision aggregates in `rq1_rq3_reporting_2026-09-21/rq12_full_precision.json`, and independently
  re-derived here from `per_run_results.csv` (five-run arithmetic mean, sample SD with n−1 — the same
  convention as the frozen aggregation) as a cross-check only.
- Latency values are copied verbatim from the verified RQ3 summary tables. Raw runs were not re-read.
- Formatting is the only transformation applied: 3 decimals, ROUND_HALF_UP, applied to the stored value.
- No winner is marked and no ranking is implied. These tables are descriptive.

## Cross-checks performed before writing

1,740 comparisons across four independent copies of the same quantities
(`aggregate_results.csv`, `aggregate_five_runs.json`, `rq12_full_precision.json`, and a fresh aggregation of
`per_run_results.csv`), plus per-cell bucket agreement between `per_run_results.csv` and `cell_metrics.json`.

243 of 1740 cross-checked values differed only in the last bits of the floating-point representation (largest absolute difference 1.11e-16); all are below the 5e-16 tolerance and none changes a 3-decimal displayed value. No substantive discrepancy was found.

One cosmetic cross-artifact difference is normalised at render time. The verified RQ3 latency tables label
the models "Gemma 4 31B" and "Qwen3.5 27B", while the publication configs record "Gemma 4 31B IT" and
"Qwen 3.5 27B". Table 4 displays the config display names so that all four tables read consistently. This is a
**display-label substitution only**, applied by an explicit fail-closed mapping in the generator (an
unrecognised label aborts the run): no latency value, count, source-run field or model ID is changed, and no
source artifact is touched. `04_latency_results.csv` additionally carries `model_id` and the verbatim
`model_source_label` from the source tables, so the substitution is fully traceable.

## Reproducing

```bash
cd evaluation/publication_experiments/results/rq1_rq3_tables
python3 code/generate_rq1_rq3_tables.py
```

Requires Python ≥ 3.9 and PyYAML. The script writes only into this directory.
